# 👋 Hello there!

My name is Matteo, and I am currently studying Astronomy at the University of Padua.  
After graduating, I plan to continue my studies abroad, possibly in Northern Europe. 🌍

I'm passionate about electronics, and in my spare time, I love diving into creating or modifying code with Python, whether for academic purposes or just for fun. 💻

I'll be creating various projects—some related to courses I've taken in Padua, and others not particularly tied to any course (including my first simple programs created to learn and practice). 📚

**Goals:** Expand my knowledge in the world of programming and learn new programming languages.  
For now, I'll be focusing on Python, with potential additions of C++ and Fortran in the not-too-distant future. 🚀

## Beyond the Code 🎯

In my free time, I love photography, especially astrophotography with my Newtonian 150/750 telescope paired with a Nikon D7100.  
You can check out some of my photos [here](#). <sub><sup><span style="color: gray; opacity: 0.7;">(Work in Progress: Photos will be added soon!)</span></sup></sub>

I'm also a fan of watching anime and TV series, and enjoy gaming on my PC or PlayStation.
